# team-proj
The Text Classification team project for ITMG4B team 1 of BSYS 4205 during the Winter 2021 term at BCIT.

The first file, BSYS4205_4B_TextClassProj, is the Python file containing the information we went over for Steven, Iana, and Amy's parts. It contains the original, unmodified code from the TensorFlow page.(https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/keras/text_classification)

The second file, BSYS_4205_ImprovedModel, is the Python file with Henry's code that modified the original model to improve its efficiency. The file can also be found here (as of 3/5/2021): https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1BVVpiWZLLQFN0aQL6LRi2lMTxYTy6wrN?usp=sharing

Please note that these two files should be run in TensorFlow, as we were unable to properly import TensorFlow into Jupyter Notebook.
