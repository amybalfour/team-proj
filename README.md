# team-proj
The Text Classification team project for ITMG4B team 1 of BSYS 4205 during the Winter 2021 term at BCIT.

The first file, BSYS4205_4B_TextClassProj, is the Python file containing the information we went over for Steven, Iana, and Amy's parts. It contains the original, unmodified code from the TensorFlow page. (https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/keras/text_classification) The file itself can also be found here (as of 3/5/2021): https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1y3oJP3yHP-iMNo5F4dRxpKaFxBM-mhnb#scrollTo=izrQBZI5yba3

The second file, BSYS4205_4B_ImprovedModel, is the Python file with Henry's code that modified the original model to improve its efficiency. The file can also be found here (as of 3/5/2021): https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1BVVpiWZLLQFN0aQL6LRi2lMTxYTy6wrN?usp=sharing

Please note that these two files should be run in Google Colab (https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/intro.ipynb), as we were unable to properly import TensorFlow into Jupyter Notebook.

Refer to our video submission for a detailed explanation on these two files.
